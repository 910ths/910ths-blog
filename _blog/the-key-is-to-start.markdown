title: The Key is to Start!

excerpt: "    How can small actions have huge impact on our lives in the future? This
  is how daily motivational writings have affected Hessa Al Omair, the designer of
  the optimistic calendar.\n\nShe says:\n     \"In my first week at my new job, I
  noticed that the work environment was negative and my colleagues were frustrated.
  I found a board in front of me and I felt compelled to write something to cheer
  them up. Especially that I love designing and writing in Arabic.  As the days passed,
  my colleagues began to admire my motivational writings and encouraged me to continue”.\n\n
  \   At the end of year 2017, the idea of designing a calendar with motivational
  Arabic quotes started when a colleague told me that she wanted her 2018 calendar
  to be designed by me! Finally, I designed and distributed more than 300 calendars
  at the beginning of the year! \n\n    Starting something new is not easy, so I will
  share here five simple tips that helped me start my own project.\nThe 5 Tips to
  Start\n\n1. Network & Relationships\nAt the beginning, and before I started printing
  and distributing calendars, I was concerned from people’s reaction to my work, but
  a lot of them were very supportive after I gave them the calendar. They even started
  sharing it through social media, which led to an increase in the number of orders’
  requests. \n\n2. Do What You Love\nDoing what you love will make you work despite
  the difficulties you face. I work in a full-time job and I only had the evenings
  to work on the calendar, which I spend half of it in family commitments. Time was
  tight, but I managed to do the thing that I love because it gave me the chance to
  express my passion for design and calligraphy.\n\n3.\tHandmade Makes you unique\nHandmade
  reflects your identity and your unique print, which no one can imitate. So the idea
  of printing my own handwriting on the calendar was the best way to design new calendars.
  \n \n4.Find out what is missing in the market\nOne of the reasons that encouraged
  me to design this calendar is when I noticed that there are few Arabic designed
  calendars. And it was my chance to design something that has clear Arabic identity
  with local touch. \n\n5. Market Your Work Through Social Media\nHaving my personal
  website and social media accounts were great help to reach a wider audience. Even
  if you don’t have your own website, I recommend you to use Tojjar as it allowed
  you to create an online store and to reach customers outside my city.\n\nFinally,
  I’d like to conclude this blog with the an inspirational quote by Robin Sharma;
  \n\"It doesn't matter where you start, only you begin\".\n\n\n"
