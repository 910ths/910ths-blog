Are a you a fresh graduate looking for a job? Or you've already finished at least 1 year experience or internship? Do you have a passion about what you do? Did you think how the recruitment process go? sometimes recruiting has nothing to do with HR debarment..

We are in a fast paced world where technology and competition is going harder and faster not just between companies but also between candidates..HUMANS!

If you think it's only about your educational background and experience and how beautiful your CV is..yes maybe..but you're wrong, there is a bigger factors..It's you..your personality and how you brand yourself to appear active, energized and knowledgeable about your industry and field. 

For example, let's say you just graduated with B.A in politics or geographic studies..you have a nice CV and good GPA..why would you get hired from another 1000 students who just graduated with you and has the same qualifications as you? good question right? 

I will take you and advise with you with a simple guide you can start immediately. 

**1-LinkedIn 
**LinkedIn is a professional network to connect with professionals from your field and follow companies that share articles and updates and might hire you one day

As you can notice both Sahal and Nourah used a professional photos, nice summary that describes what they do and their passion or in a storytelling style to attract whoever looking at their profile and understand there is a human behind this profile who understands his/her field..keep it simple and appealing. 

2- Create a simple nice CV using any tool or your own design skills. 
here is a chrome extension you download then auto export your LinkedIn profile with it: https://ceev.io/

3- Participate in conversations that matters to you and your industry..you think its hard? no trust me! 
Schedule a 30 mins everyday to comment and follow people on Twitter and Linkedin and share your opinion with them..now you tell me you're wasting time..not really, you're actually learning from people who has more experience than you and getting your name shown!

4- Take courses, extra courses..keep learning! add these certificates to your CV and LinkedIn. 
* https://www.doroob.sa for free courses

5- Attend meet ups, events and conferences so you network with people from your industry to share ideas and learn from each other. 
check your city events calendar. 
download meetup app https://www.meetup.com/apps 
Be confident to meet new people and stay active.

6- Create a portfolio for yourself wether its a service or speech or a design you made. 
Do 1 month free internship in your cousin's firm to learn more. 
Sign up to https://bahr.910ths.sa/ and start freelancing! 

7- Subscribe to newsletters and websites that sends you weekly updates about your industry and be updated about your field so whenever there is a discussion in your field wether on Twitter and LinkedIn you can participate and share knowledge. 

8- Do initiatives for the community that shows your skills.
I remember an engineer who didn't find a job but created solar power energy on the roof of a mosque to help cut costs and use the money to help others, someone share a case study about him doing that and then he immediately was hired. 

What i mean here, if you really like what you do and want to have your own personal brand you have to be active and do actions not look around you and say no i can't find a job..i can't help. 
Well you are wrong, of course you can find a way just learn more about your industry and how you can add value to people, companies or community..then dramatically you'll find yourself building a personal brand for you on how good you are in your field.

This was a basic personal branding guide to start..

I hope this would help..
